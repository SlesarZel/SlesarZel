- 👋 Hi, I’m @SlesarZel, my real name is Pavel (Paul)
- 👀 I’m interested (and working in this sphere) in RF and digital design, also I really love engineering (especially aircrafts).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, just because I'm interesting in it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on RF hacker's project (LoRa/IoT or etc), aircrafts (copters, airplanes, maybe something new) or financial project. I'm open to suggestions to participate in your projects.
